# Topic Modeling

Here is a paragraph explaining **topic modeling**, describing the method. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

Topic Modeling is something like *an actual representation of topics*. The only difference is that **it doesn't represent topics**! It doesn't exist! What would a '*topic*' even be?! I just created this text to demonstrate how the **showcase** page content works. You can write whatever you want here with full markdown support.
